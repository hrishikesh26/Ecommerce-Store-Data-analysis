# Ecommerce Store Data Analysis with important key performance indicators (KPI).

### üëâ EDA description - 
- This project is an ecommerce store data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- The main objectives are to explore the user behavior, order frequency, retention rate, and promocode usage of the online store.
- The data consists of two CSV files containing the order details from November 2022 to February 2023.
- The analysis involves importing dependencies, loading and merging the datasets, cleaning and filtering the data, calculating various metrics, and visualizing the results using matplotlib, plotly, and seaborn libraries.
- The notebook also contains comments and explanations for each step of the analysis.


## ‚û°Ô∏è The project (Jupyter notebook) contains the following insights from the ecommerce store data analysis:

- The data consists of two CSV files containing the order details from November 2022 to February 2023, with 59 columns and 400,216 rows in total.
- The data was cleaned and filtered by dropping unnecessary columns, removing null values, and dropping cancelled orders. The final data frame had 45 columns and 394,326 rows.
- The data was analyzed by calculating various metrics such as order frequency, retention rate, promocode usage, and revenue. The results were visualized using matplotlib, plotly, and seaborn libraries.
- Some of the key findings from the analysis are:

    - The order frequency of the users varied from 1.38 to 1.43 orders per month, with February having the highest frequency and December having the lowest.
    - The retention rate of the users decreased from 46.5% in December to 36.4% in February, indicating a high churn rate among the customers.
    - The promocode usage of the users was low, with only 14.9% of the orders using a promocode starting with 'PR', 'pr', or 'Pr'.
    - The revenue of the store increased from ‚Çπ1,18,47,953 in November to ‚Çπ1,64,25,650 in February, with a peak of ‚Çπ1,72,88,264 in January.
    - The average order value (AOV) of the users was ‚Çπ3,938.50, with February having the highest AOV (‚Çπ4,038.50) and December having the lowest (‚Çπ3,838.50).
